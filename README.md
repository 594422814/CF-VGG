# CPU Real-Time Correlation Tracking via Joint Model Compression and Transfer
We train an extremely lightweight CNN model named CF-VGGM (only 1.5MB) for state-of-the-art deep CF trackers (e.g., ECO and DeepSTRCF).
The pretrained tiny model helps deep CF trackers achieve #CPU real-time# speed with almost the same tracking accuracy.

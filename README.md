# CPU Real-Time Correlation Tracking via Joint Model Compression and Transfer

We train an extremely lightweight CNN model named CF-VGGM (only 1.5MB) for state-of-the-art deep CF trackers (e.g., ECO and DeepSTRCF).

The pretrained tiny model helps deep CF trackers achieve **CPU Real-Time** speed with almost the same tracking accuracy.
